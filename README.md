# Basal Ganglia simulation in NEST-Simulator
Simulation of  two groups of neurons (left and right) where each has own populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons.
## How to run on OSX
0. Install brew if you don't have it already
1. Install NEST-Simulator
```brew install nest-simulator```
2.  Use python executable from  Cellar. In my case, the full path was:
```/opt/homebrew/Cellar/python@3.12/3.12.7_1/bin/python3.12```
